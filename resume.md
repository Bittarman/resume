Profile
-------
  I have a passion for programming, it having been a lifelong hobby, starting from a very early age when I was given a computer by my father and learning to code in BASIC in order to be able to play games which often needed minor adaptions in order to run on the Sharp MZ80k I started with. Then through secondary school I became a big fan of the Doom and Quake games, and quickly joined in the craze of creating mods, with one of the ones I worked on being featured of cover discs of games magazines in the mid 90’s.

Experience

Web Developer, Dickies; Midsomer Norton, Somerset – 2018-present

 At Dickies, I am a part of the E-Commerce Development team, which involved optimising and enhancing the  E-Commerce platform developed in house at Dickies. I have lead some key projects while at Dickies, including; Integration with EBay via its MIP interface, which opened up Dickies to a new channel, quickly seeing impressive results and excellent growth. Improving the on-site product search system, using elastic search, and implementing server side rendering and page composition through varnish esi. Changing hosting to AWS, setting up the site to run in multiple availability hosting zones, increasing resiliency, and leveraging other advantages of AWS such as cloud front and RDS, which also increased performance. 
  My role has also included continuous personal development, and myself and the other members of the team were encouraged to keep ourselves informed of best practices and new technologies.

Lead Developer, Lupimedia; Yeovil, Somerset – 2007-2018

 My role at Lupimedia varied over time, from day to day programming, and leading the development team, to initial customer contact meetings and designing and planning solutions for customers. The work has also involved being subcontracted on occasion to work as a member of other teams, including Canal & River Trust during their transition from British Waterways to becoming a charity. I lead the Canal & River Trust team with a complete redesign of their website, and content management system. We then were contracted again to further assist with a second overhaul of  their content management, to incorporate a new approach to solving their needs.

Technician, SPC International; Templecombe, Somerset – 2004 - 2007

 At SPC International I joined as a level 1 technician, and quickly rose to level 3. I was in the ATM rework department for the majority of my  time at SPC. I quickly moved from the main line of rework, and mostly worked on one off, or undocumented parts from machines of varying age and vendors. I also built and maintained test equipment for the department, designing test rigs for parts to reduce time spent in testing, by allowing parts to be hot swapped from running systems, rather than needing to reboot the systems between each part.
For the last year of my time at SPC, I oversaw the movement of server repairs from the site in Hitchin to Templecombe when SPC closed down the  Hitchin site. This mostly involved identifying common parts and creating new rework procedures for those parts, determining common failures.
Along side creation of the server rework department, I also created a parts forecast ordering system. This system took order forecasts from customers, and inspected a database of past repairs for those parts, approximated the required parts which would be needed for those repairs, and produced an order sheet for the stores manager. This system was in use for several years after my departure, creating orders valued in the region of £500,000 a month.

Additional Experience 
---------------------

Zend Certification Advisory Board, Zend Framework 2 Certification; Remote – 2013

 Due to my participation and active community role during the development of Zend Framework 2, I was invited to take part in the creation of the Zend Framework certification for ZF2.
Each person on the board was assigned sections to work on, with the sections assigned to myself being Database and Security.

Zend; Remote - 2013

 Having worked on the certification advisory board, I was later asked by Gary Hockin who was working for Zend at the time, to assist writing  material for the ZF2 certification training course.

Technical Editor, McGraw Hill; Remote – 2010

 Due to my active work in the Zend Framework open source project, I was approached by Vikram Vaswani to assist as the Technical editor for his book “Zend Framework: A Beginners Guide”. This involved inspecting and testing all code samples supplied, advising on best practices, and  ensuring that claims and statements in the text were accurate.

Conference Speaker, PHP North West; Manchester – 2010

 I gave a presentation entitled “Zend Framework: Getting to grips” which was well received at the PHP North West conference. My talk involved a live coding section, for which I created a simple sandbox for evaluating PHP code asynchronously via ajax, and displaying the result. I also gave this talk at the first PHP South West meeting in the same year, and again on a Zend Webinar.
